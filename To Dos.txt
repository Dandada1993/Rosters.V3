Issues:
=======
When shift cut and pasted the location and default position are not showing in the shift dialog (fixed)

Need to add position to list of employees

Add the following menu options
Roster\Copy from (provide a dialog of weeks with saved rosters)
Roster\Delete all shifts (needs confirmation)
Shifts\Cut
Shifts\Copy
Shifts\Paste
Shifts\Change location\<list locations>
Shifts\Change qualifier
Shifts\Change position
Shifts\Excuse code\<list excuse codes>

Shortcuts\Manage - allow managers to add shortcuts

Copy From is hidden when roster has not been saved (fixed).

Maintenance shifts with a location specified do not seem to export to Acumen (was not an issue. database query used to verify the inserts was incorrect)

Finish the functionality for Change position. The position include the qualifier so need to account for that. (completed)

Algorithm for Saving Roster
===========================
1. Save all employees where the ID (not emp_no) is 0. On saving update the ID.
2. Save all shifts where the isDirty is true.
3. On deletion of row from roster. Record employee ID in array and delete all employees, listed in the array, and their shifts.

If an employee is delete and re-added the ID should be 0.
