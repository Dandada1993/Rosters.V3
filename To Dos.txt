Algorithm for Saving Roster
===========================
1. Save all employees where the ID (not emp_no) is 0. On saving update the ID.
2. Save all shifts where the isDirty is true.
3. On deletion of row from roster. Record employee ID in array and delete all employees, listed in the array, and their shifts.

If an employee is delete and re-added the ID should be 0.
