Export the roster to Acumen the final copy of the roster is printed. Any printing prior to this roster should show the DRAFT on the printed copy?

Use Promise.all to ensure that all relevant data is loaded before employee and saved schedules are loaded.

Issues:
=======
When shift cut and pasted the location and default position are not showing in the shift dialog (fixed)

Add the following menu options
Roster\Copy from (provide a dialog of weeks with saved rosters)
Roster\Delete all shifts (needs confirmation)
Shifts\Cut
Shifts\Copy
Shifts\Paste
Shifts\Change location\<list locations>
Shifts\Change qualifier
Shifts\Change position
Shifts\Excuse code\<list excuse codes>

Shortcuts\Manage - allow managers to add shortcuts

Copy From is hidden when roster has not been saved (fixed).

	Return roster.id with saved schedules (done)
	If shift's roster.id does not match the roster.id of the current shown roster make the cell read only and do not include in the hours. If you decide to make the cell editable what happens to the rosterID when the shift is saved?
	Separate loaned hours from total hours as loaned hours do not contribute to the branches weekly hours (done).
	Should support be added for specifying a loan shift as @locID or 'D @locID' to specify a day schedule @locID? Specify a loan but not hours.
	If the roster has not been saved where we pull from the data on Common we still need to include shifts from other rosters at the branch except for (grd and mm) (done)
	
Roster report that it saved successfully when it did not (done).

Schedules with qualifiers e.g. #REST seem to lose the # symbol when format('short') is called (done).

Visiting employee from another branch was saved as local employee and hence appeared twice when roster was reloaded (done).

When deleting all shifts (or a single shift) if that employee is visiting and the visiting location has already exported the roster to Acumen then ask the user to confirm whether to delete that shift.

When deleting all shifts (or a single shift) if the employee is on loan and the loaned location has already exported their roster to Acumen then ask the user to confirm whether to delete that shift.

Loaned hours not to be substracted for GRD and MM (done)

Split shifts with two different position are not displaying the correct shift string

Algorithm for Saving Roster
===========================
1. Save all employees where the ID (not emp_no) is 0. On saving update the ID.
2. Save all shifts where the isDirty is true.
3. On deletion of row from roster. Record employee ID in array and delete all employees, listed in the array, and their shifts.

If an employee is delete and re-added the ID should be 0.
